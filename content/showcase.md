## Targeted Audience 
The targeted audience for my portfolio are professors, whether from McMaster or others, my current programming professor, Gemma Repiso Puigdelliura, fellow students and potential employers. 

## My Goals

I am hoping to build a portfolio here to showcase important codes and projects to present to future employers. I would like to eventually build a career in programming or at least use my background in programming, that I will gain from this course, as an important skill for future jobs/projects. 

##Programs

The programs I am hoping to include in my portfolio will be my own created swirl course, as well as other important sources of code that I can use to showcase my experience to employers.

# Hi everyone, 

My name is Margaret and I am a fourth year, Cognitive Science of Language Student here at McMaster University. I love animals, and I have one dog who is an 8 year old Golden Retriever. 

I was born in Canada, but my background is Vietnamese. English is my main language but I can somewhat understand Vietnamese as well. 

My special interests are soccer, knitting, fashion, art (painting) and music. A few of my favourite music artists are Tyler the Creator, Playboi Carti, Rosalia, PinkPanthress and FKA Twigs, but I like a lot of different genres and artists as well. 

I'm excited to learn more about programming, as it is something I am interested in as my potential future career, but as for now, I am full time student with a part-time job at the Apple store. 

Thanks for listening.
